# Steemit Bubbles
Show steemit followers in a d3 bubble chart (circle packing), with a circle size depending on the vesting shares.

## Usage
* `yarn install`
* `yarn run dev` for development
* `yarn run build` for production build

## TODO
* show a nice loader animation (in css or svg only) for the api call waiting time
* improve circle view (username lables donÂ´t really work right now) or only show top followers
* improve styling (input field, tooltip)
* calculate reputation and steem power from existing values
* let users switch between followers and following
* let users choose different values for the circle size (reputation, sbd_balance, ...)
* maybe switch to react and ant design
